WaTor
=====

In December, 1984, A.K. Dewdney wrote about a mythical world named WaTor.  This is a Visual C++ AppWizard program that simulates the harsh life on this world.

Because WaTor is toroidal, the top edge of the grid is connected to the bottom 
edge of the grid, and the left edge of the grid is connected to the right edge 
of the grid. So, if a fish swims off of the left edge of the grid, it will reappear
on the right edge of the grid.

There are two species of fish that live on WaTor: tuna and sharks. The tuna feed
on the abundant supply of plankton that live in the ocean, and the sharks feed on the tuna. 
Both kinds of fish can reproduce when they reach a certain age. (Oddly, their reproduction is accomplished by fission -- one fish splitting into two fish.) 
Though there is plenty of plankton such that the tuna never starve, sharks will starve if they go too long without eating tuna.
